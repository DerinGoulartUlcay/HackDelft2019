General declaration rules
We have different types of claims, with specific conditions, methods of reimbursement and method of payment. On the pages of the different types of reimbursements you will find detailed information per type of claim.
The general rules of the declaration game are as follows:
- Send the declaration form with receipts by mail to Central Reception (link sends e-mail). You can submit the pieces scanned or as a clearly legible photo. You are responsible for keeping any original documents in accordance with the tax retention period (7 years). The retention period also applies if you have left the company in the meantime.
- The language used for submitting a claim is English.
- You can ask the HR Service Desk a question about a declaration (link sends e-mail). Central Reception is purely for the processing of the declarations themselves.
- It is not possible to claim on the basis of a debit card. It must be clearly demonstrable what you made the expense for and you can't see that on a pinbon.
- Your proof of payment must clearly show what kind of costs it is. It is not possible to claim on the basis of a proof of payment with incomplete information.
- The date in the detail line is the date of the proof of payment/invoice.
- Declare on time! - No later than 2 weeks after the customer's approval (written confirmation) if the costs may be passed on to the customer. - At the latest 4 months after the invoice date (for general invoices). - A flexworker's invoice for costs incurred in the first three quarters of the current year must be received by Centrale Ontvangst by 15 November at the latest in order to be settled via the flexworker's arrangement for that year in question. Flexible invoices for the last quarter may be submitted in the first quarter of the following year (must have been received by Central Reception by 31 March at the latest). If that period has expired, the invoices will no longer be processed.
- Invoices will be made payable within 2 weeks after receipt of the documents in the mailbox of Central Reception, provided that the documents received are complete and complete.
- In the regular payment schedule for direct payments, you will receive the amount on your account 2 working days after your claim has been given the status of 90.
- Most flexible declarations and all declarations from the Personal Budget are paid out with the salary. The invoice must be complete and processed by the 1st of the month in order to go along with the salary. All claims that get the status "80 - Paying out" after the first of the month, will be paid out one month later with salary. Example: the declaration gets the status 80 on August 3, payment follows with the salary of September.
- In the event that you receive a more generous payment from the client than described in our terms of employment, the Sogeti rules will continue to apply. (Think of 25 EUR compensation for a dinner, lunches for personal use that are not reimbursed).
- If you have incurred expenses abroad, please indicate this with a tick in the first screen. You enter the amount of the invoice (and not already converted to EUR) throughout the invoice. The application will calculate the amount in EUR when the declaration gets the status "Submitted, send documents".
- By sending and therefore submitting the declaration, you declare that you agree with the conditions that are set for the declaration of costs, as described in the Personnel Guide.
